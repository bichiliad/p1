Client
    receives a message of type
        ACK
            if msg.seqNum = 0 // response to connection
                set connection ID, ready to connect, etc.
            else
                send to SendWindow, which // c.sendWindow.add(msg)
                    checks if it's in the window
                        true -> replace data with ack
                        false -> ignore it
                send messages in writeQueue until they're out of window range
        DATA
            send to ReceiveWindow, which
                checks to see if it's higher than old window
                    true -> update window, toss out lowest
                    false -> add it to the ReceiveWindow, if necessary
                    NOTE: if you get something out of window range, that's bad.
                Update messages in read queue.
        CONN
            Something's wrong, you shouldn't get that.

    sends a new data message (assuming has SeqNum already)
        check if window has room
            true -> send it, add to SendWindow
            false -> add to send queue



SendWindow - Ensures sent messages were received
    has the following fields:
        window : map [int -> msg]        represents sent messages
        base : int                       represents bottom of window
        size : int                       represents window size
    has the following functions:
        add(msg) : nil ->
                if inWindow(msg) -> add to map, error otherwise
        ack(msg) : bool ->
                acks sent message, updates window
                returns true if window is updated, false otherwise
        inWindow(msg) : bool ->
                checks if message is in range of sending

ReceiveWindow - Caches the last [windowsize] messages
    has the following fields:
        window : map [int -> msg]       represents received messages
        base : int                       represents bottom of window
        size : int                       represents window size
    has the following functions:
        receive(msg) : nil ->
                Adds to map, updating window if necessary



??????
Do we need to send the LAST w messages received, or the ones IN the range of w received?
[1, 3, 4] or [3, 4] if our window is [2, 3, 4]
